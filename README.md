#huey - An API for Louisiana Statutory Law
## Overview
This project, huey, hopes to make Louisiana statutory law more readily accessible 
developers.  It is inspired by [Eric Mill's work](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/12/the-united-states-code-is-on-github.html)
on the U.S. Code [github repo here](https://github.com/unitedstates).
Although the State of Louisiana makes its laws [available on the internet](http://legis.la.gov/lss/toc.htm), it's
now impossible for developers to access these laws in a programmatic way.

For starters, I am developing a scraper, written in php, to retrieve and order all 
the Louisiana laws in a database.  After that, I'll move on to developing a RESTful API.

### Scraper
The scraper is still very much experimental.
Usage:
    php index.php

### RESTful API
Still in the planning stages.

### The name?
The project is dedicated to this guy:
